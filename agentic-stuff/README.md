# Instructions

All of these instructions have a very specific structure described in them. I use this structure in all of my pet-projects, but you need to modify it according to your requirements.

## copilot-instructions.md

Should be placed under `.github/` as it is a global prompt instead of `/.github/instructions/`

## instructions/

Custom instructions for different parts of the codebase. For example, `web.instructions.md` contains instructions specific to the web app.

# Agents
